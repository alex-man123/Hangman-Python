# ðŸª“ Hangman â€“ Simple Python Project

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game using Python.  
The game runs in the command line, where the player must guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters, with a limited number of incorrect attempts allowed.

This project is designed for beginners and demonstrates basic Python concepts such as:
- conditionals
- loops
- lists
- string manipulation
- user input handling

No external libraries or graphical interface are used. Just Python and your terminal.

Feel free to use or improve it!
